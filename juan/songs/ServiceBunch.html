      <h1>"Service Bunch"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of TV's "Brady Bunch" theme</p>
      <p>Here's the story<br />
        Of a service Framework<br />
        which is building up its lovely APIs<br />
        The framework's not so old<br />
        like some others<br />
        And you can test with curl</p>
      <p>It's the story<br />
        Of a Fusion Framework<br />
        which has open source and some is home grown<br />
        You will find them<br />
        Sitting altogether<br />
        At Fusion Central's home</p>
      <p>Filled in one place with a WSDL and its schemas<br />
        and you know that it's way much more than a hunch<br />
        That tag groups can somehow form an API<br />
        That's the way it all became the service bunch</p>
      <p>The service bunch, the service bunch<br />
        That's the way it became the service bunch</p>
    </div>
  </body>
