            <h1>"Open Rewrite"</h1>
            <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Sound of Music"</p>

            <p>The builds are alive with the open rewrite<br>
                With code I've not changed in a thousand years<br>
                The builds fill my heart with the open rewrite<br>
                My code wants to build again without fears<br>
                My code wants to build with the things from changes it tries from the great recipes</p>

            <p class="short-song">My code can be changed in the time that files from runs of recipes<br>
                So take a good look at its tips and all of those things it does say<br>
                Don't work through the night or til dark, so get going and play<br>
                I go to the builds when my code is ready<br>
                I know it is near what I had before<br>
                My code will run tests with the open rewrite<br>
                And I'll sling some more</p>
        </div>
