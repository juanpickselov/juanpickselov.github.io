      <h1>"Blackboard"</h1>
      <p>A song for WebCT, lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Beatle's "Blackbird"</p>

      <p>Blackboard stinging in the dead of night<br>  
        We like WebCT, so don't you cry</p>
        
      <p>All your life<br>  
        You were only waiting for this moment to arise.</p>  

      <p>Blackboard stinging in the dead of night<br>  
        We really do like WebCT</p>  

      <p>All your life<br>   
        You were only waiting for this moment to be free.</p>

      <p>Blackboard cry Blackboard cry<br>
        Into the light of the dark black night.</p>  

      <p>Blackboard cry Blackboard cry<br>
        Into the light of the dark black night.</p>  

      <p>Blackboard stinging in the dead of night<br>  
        We like WebCT, so don't you cry</p>

      <p>All your life<br>  
        You were only waiting for this moment to arise<br>
        You were only waiting for this moment to arise<br>
        You were only waiting for this moment to arise.</p>
