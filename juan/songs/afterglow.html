      <h1>"Afterglow Revisited"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Genesis "Afterglow"</p>
      <p>
        Dust to dust that saddened all around me<br />
        He has found a new home<br />
        The toys and games that used to give him laughter<br />
        They're all silent to me now<br />
        But I, I would search everywhere<br />
        Just to find a cure<br />
        And Walk upon longer roads than this one<br />
        In a world I hoped you would explore<br />
        I miss you more
      <p>
        And my son who rested on his pillow<br />
        Leaving the warmth of this life<br />
        And the sounds that echoed all around me<br />
        I cried and grimaced through the night<br />
        But how, you went through everything<br />
        I give to you my son<br />
        And the meaning of all that I believed before<br />
        Escapes me in this world of none, no thing and no one
      </p>
      <p>
        And I would search everywhere<br />
        Just to see your smile<br />
        And walk upon longer roads than this one<br />
        In a world I hoped you would explore<br />
        How you went through everything<br />
        I give to you my son<br />
        The meaning of all that I believed before<br />
        Escapes me in this world of none,<br />
        I miss you more.
