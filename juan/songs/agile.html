      <h1>"Agile"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Sting's "Fragile"</p>

      <p>If code will flow when cards and points are done<br />
        checking for the color of the tests we run<br />
        Tomorrow's gains will watch more cards get played<br />
        And building up our tests we safely say<br />
        This app's going to work as meant<br />
        To all of our requirements<br />
        That something comes from diligence as working software should<br />
        For all this work will be seen from afar<br />
        Lest we forget how agile we are
      </p>

      <p>On and on cards on the wall<br />
        As pairs work real hard, as pairs work real hard<br />
        On and on the cards we play<br />
        How agile we are, how agile we are
      </p>

      <p>On and on cards on the wall<br />
        As pairs work real hard, as pairs work real hard<br />
        On and on the cards we play<br />
        How agile we are, how agile we are<br />
        How agile we are, how agile we are
      </p>
