      <h1>"Nesting Tables"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Adele's "Turning Tables"</p>
      <p>Deep enough to stop the web<br />
        All that page weight is such a bore<br />
        God only knows what we nested for<br />
        And that one day, you shall say no more</p>
      <p>We can't put up with your nesting tables<br />
        Under their weight, we can't breathe</p>
      <p>So we can't let you code the stuff that hurts us<br />
        No, we will task you, you to just desert them<br />
        We can't live with waits you thought were harmless<br />
        It's time to say goodbye to nesting tables, nesting tables</p>
      <p>Under daunting sites I saw<br />
        Where speed was lost, your nests were found<br />
        We saved hundreds of tags to leave you<br />
        As hard as you try, no, you will never be kept round</p>
      <p>We can't put up with your nesting tables<br />
        Under their weight, we can't breathe</p>
      <p>So we can't let you code the stuff that hurts us<br />
        No, we will task you, you to just desert them<br />
        We can't live with waits you thought were harmless<br />
        It's time to say goodbye to nesting tables, nesting tables</p>
      <p>Next time we'll be lighter, we'll be download savers<br />
        With the weight that cost us<br />
        Next time we'll be lighter, we'll be download savers<br />
        Coding in a style sheet</p>
      <p>We can't let you code the stuff that hurts us<br />
        No, we will task you, you to just desert them<br />
        We can't live with waits you thought were harmless<br />
        It's time to say goodbye to nesting tables, to nesting tables<br />
        Nesting tables, yeah, nesting</p>
