      <h1>"Card Wall"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Pink Floyd's "The Wall"</p>
      <p>We all need to estimate them.<br />
        We dont need no waterfall.<br />
        New chart that tracks them in the team room.<br />
        Team mates, move those cards to done.</p>
      
        <p>Hey, Team mates, move those cards to done!</p>
        
        <p>All in all its just another card on the wall.<br />
        All in all you're just another card on the wall.</p>

      <p>We all need to estimate them.<br />
        We dont need no waterfall.<br />
        New chart that tracks them in the team room.</p>
      
        <p>Team mates, move those cards to done.</p>
        
        <p>Hey, Team mates, move those cards to done!<br />
        All in all you're just another card on the wall.<br />
        All in all you're just another card on the wall.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
