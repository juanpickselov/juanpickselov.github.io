      <h1>"Made For Codin' Ruby"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Kiss' "Made for Lovin' You"</p>
      <p>
        To write, It's expressive in all you do<br />
        With marked less<br />
        There's so much you're gonna do<br />
        And to write you'll wanna play it's very sweet<br />
        'Cause world, it was made for you<br />
        but world, you would code in C<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I was made for codin' in Ruby<br />
        You won't find me codin' C<br />
        And I can't git enough of you Ruby<br />
        Can you git some gems for me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        To write, you will see right before your eyes<br />
        Zeal that's mythic<br />
        Share something that's derived from files<br />
        And to write we're gonna rake it all so true<br />
        'Cause world, Ruby's made for me<br />
        And world it was made for you<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I was made for codin' in Ruby<br />
        You won't find me codin' C<br />
        And I can't git enough of you Ruby<br />
        Can you git some gems for me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I was made for codin' in Ruby<br />
        You won't find me codin' C<br />
        And I can git it all for you Ruby<br />
        Can you git it all for me<br />
      </p>
