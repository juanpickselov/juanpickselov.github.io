      <h1>"St. Jude"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Beatles "Hey Jude"</p>
      <p>This song is dedicated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a re-write of The Beatles "Hey Jude"</p>
      <p>St. Jude, when things get bad,<br/>
        take a sick child and make them better.<br/>
        Their founder, he let them in with his heart,<br/>
        so they could start to make them better.</p>

      <p>Hey youth, don't be afraid,<br/>
        it was built to give you all shelter.<br/>
        The minute they get you gladly checked in,<br/>
        then they begin to make you better.</p>

      <p>And anytime you feel the pain,<br/>
        St. Jude steps in,<br/>
        they'll take the world off of your shoulder.</p>

      <p>For well, you know that it's for you<br/>
        they are so cool,<br/>
        by working hard to help you grow older.</p>

      <p>Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na.</p>

      <p>St. Jude, won't let you down.<br/>
        Thanks to their founder and the help there.<br/>
        Remember he let them in with his heart,<br/>
        so they could start to make you better.</p>

      <p>When they reach out and let you in<br/>
        St. Jude, begins, their comforting someone in need of help.</p>

      <p>And don't you know that it's for you?<br/>
        St. Jude, they'll do, the moment your need is told there.</p>

      <p>Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na.</p>

      <p>St. Jude, when things get bad,<br/>
        take a sick child and make them better.<br/>
        Their founder, he let them in with his heart,<br/>
        then they begin to make it better, better, better, better, better, better, oh!</p>

      <p>Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, St. Jude.</p>
