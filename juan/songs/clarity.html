      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of John Mayer's "Gravity"</p>
      <p>Clarity is tracking my time sheets<br />
        And clarity wants to write them down<br />
        Oh, your hours show and makes this plan<br />
        With all the dates and the build demand<br />
        Dream of ways to track it all today</p>
      <p>
        Whoa, clarity is tracking my time sheets<br />
        And clarity wants to write them down<br />
        Oh, once a week and early's good<br />
        And keep maintained like we all should<br />
        It's reporting on who's gotta send them in, so please!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh once a week and early's good<br />
        And keep maintained like we all should<br />
        It's reporting on who's gotta send them in, so please!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whoa, clarity, keep my time today for me<br />
        Whoa, clarity is even better managed see<br />
        Know how that can be?<br />
        Just show me where the time is<br />
        Just show me where the time is<br />
        Just show me where the time is<br />
        Come on show me where the time is<br />
        Come on show me where, show me where the time is.
