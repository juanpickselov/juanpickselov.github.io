    <h1>"Icons Please"</h1>
    <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing"</p>

    <p>Now look at them consoles, not the way we do it<br>
        We click the mouse upon an icon see?<br>
        We ain't typin', that's the way we do it<br>
        typing out nothin' and our clicks are free<br>
        Now that ain't typin', that's the way we do it<br>
        Lemme tell ya, us guys ain't dumb<br>
        We don't want a blister on our little finger<br>
        We don't want a blister on our thumb<br>
        We got to install cloud applications, custom coded deliveries<br>
        We got to move these configurations, we gotta move to cloud you see<br>
        See the little icon with the title and the target<br>
        Yeah, buddy, that loads an app<br>
        That little icon got its application<br>
        That saves me typing letters and much time<br>
        We got to install cloud applications, custom coded deliveries<br>
        We got to move these configurations, we gotta move to cloud you see<br>
        We got to install cloud applications, custom coded deliveries<br>
        We got to move these configurations, we gotta move to cloud you see<br>
        Looky here, look out<br>
        You shoulda learned to make a shortcut<br>
        You shoulda learned to make them run<br>
        Look at that icon, we got it startin' in the windows menu<br>
        You can make some<br>
        And input here, what's that?<br>
        turning up noses?<br>
        Typin' on the keyboard like a chimpanzee<br>
        We ain't typin', that's the way we do it<br>
        No we're typing out nothin', and our clicks are free<br>
        We got to install cloud applications, custom coded deliveries<br>
        We got to move these configurations, we gotta move to cloud you see<br>
        Listen here<br>
        Now we ain't typin' that's the way we do it<br>
        We click the mouse upon the icon see?<br>
        We ain't typin', that's the way we do it<br>
        typing out nothin' and our clicks are free<br>
        typing out nothin', clicks are free<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' and our clicks are free<br>
        Ooh, typing out nothin', clicks are free<br>
        typing out nothin', clicks are free (typin', typin', typin')<br>
        typing out nothin', clicks are free</p>

    <p>No we're typing out nothin', and the clicks are free<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' and the clicks are free<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' and the clicks are free</p>

    <p>Look at that, look at that<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' (I want my, I want my)<br>
        clicks are free (I want my icons please)<br>
        typing out nothin', clicks are free (I want my, I want my, I want my icons please)<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' (I want my, I want my)<br>
        And the clicks are free (I want my icons please)<br>
        No we're typing out nothin' (I want my, I want my)<br>
        And the clicks are free (I want my icons please)<br>
        Easy, easy typing out nothin' (I want my, I want my)<br>
        Easy, easy clicks are free (I want my icons please)<br>
        Easy, easy typing out nothin' (I want my, I want my)<br>
        clicks are free (I want my icons please)<br>
        We ain't typin'</p>

    <p>typing out nothing, clicks are free<br>
        typing out nothing, clicks are free</p>
