      <h1>"Code Boat"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Paul Williams "Love Boat Theme"</p>

      <p>Code, we're writing for you<br />
        Come aboard, we're compiling too<br />
        Code, that's tested rewards<br />
        Let it flow, get feedback to you
      </p>

      <p>The Code Boat soon will be making another run<br />
        The Code Boat promises something for everyone<br />
        Set a course for refactor<br />
        Don't give bugs another chance
      </p>

      <p>Code won't hurt to explore<br />
        Tests and compiles a green trending score<br />
        Yes, code<br />
        It's code
      </p>

      <p>The Code Boat soon will be making another run<br />
        The Code Boat promises something for everyone<br />
        Set a course for refactor<br />
        Don't give bugs another chance
      </p>

      <p>Code won't hurt to explore<br />
        Tests and compiles a green trending score<br />
        It's code, it's code, it's code<br />
        It's the Code Boat, it's the Code Boat
      </p>
