      <h1>"Hope!"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Beatles' "Help!"</p>
      <p>Hope! She needs somebody,<br />
        Hope! Not just anybody,<br />
        Hope! You know a heart surgeon,<br />
        Hope!</p>

      <p>When she was younger, not much younger than today,<br />
        She really needed everybody's help in every way,<br />
        But now this day has come that she's oh so well endured,<br />
        Now she finds we've fixed her heart, she's going up a floor.</p>

      <p>Hope believe you can, you're healing now,<br />
        And we do appreciate you're coming 'round,<br />
        Hope you get your feet back on the ground,<br />
        Won't you please, please Hope heal?</p>

      <p>And now your life has changed in oh so many ways,<br />
        your past incident seems to vanish in a haze,<br />
        But ev'ry now and then we need to be sure,<br />
        We know that we just need you like we've ever known before.</p>

      <p>Hope believe you can, you're healing now,<br />
        And we do appreciate you're coming 'round,<br />
        Hope you get your feet back on the ground,<br />
        Won't you please, please Hope heal?</p>

      <p>When she was younger, not much younger than today,<br />
        She really needed everybody's help in every way,<br />
        But now this day has come that She's oh so well endured,<br />
        Now she finds we've fixed her heart, she's going up a floor.</p>

      <p>Hope believe you can, you're healing now,<br />
        And We do appreciate you're coming 'round,<br />
        Hope you get your feet back on the ground,<br />
        Won't you please, please Hope heal?</p>

      <p>Hope heal, Hope heal Ooh.</p>
