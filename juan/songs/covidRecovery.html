      <h1>"Covid Recovery"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of SuperTramp's "Crime of the Century"</p>

      <p>Now we're planning the covid recovery<br>
      For you and for me<br>
      Read all about vaccines and the distancing<br>
      Yes, it's well worth you'll see</p>

      <p>So roll up your sleeves<br>
      Go to see the weary nurse<br>
      Don't let it go bad to worse</p>

      <p>Women and men you trust with family<br>
      Put on the masks as we've seen<br>
      And stay apart six feet as we're social<br>
      To save you and save me</p>

      <p>That can be</p>
