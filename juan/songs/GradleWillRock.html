      <h1>"Gradle Will Rock"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Van Halen's "And the Cradle Will Rock"</p>
      <p>
        Ow!<br />
        Ow, yeah<br />
        You know<br />
        Ow!<br />
        Ow, ow!</p>
      <p>Well, they say it's kind' enlightenin' how this younger generation slings<br />
        You know, it's core's not just some automation<br />
        Well, the code is into building sweet<br />
        And you'll want to take more than a peek<br />
        You know, it's more than just a compilation</p>

      <p>And the Gradle will rock<br />
        Yes, the Gradle, Gradle will rock<br />
        And I say, rock code<br />
        Ooh, rock code</p>
      <p>And when some groovy code gets down, they turn to a good one around<br />
        That way, your next release is made such a joy, such a joy<br />
        (Your next release such a joy)<br />
        And at every stage its hard to beat<br />
        Ends up ready for the streets<br />
        And it's all deployed<br />
        (all deployed)<br />
        Ow!</p>

      <p>And the Gradle will rock, ow!<br />
        And, the Gradle, the Gradle will rock<br />
        And I say, rock code<br />
        Oh I say rock code</p>

      <p>Have you seen maven's grades?<br />
        Ow!</p>

      <p>And when some groovy code gets down, they turn to a good one around<br />
        That way, your next release is made such a joy, such a joy<br />
        (Your next release such a joy)<br />
        And so at every stage its hard to beat<br />
        Ends up ready for the streets<br />
        And it's all deployed, yes folks are overjoyed</p>

      <p>And the Gradle will rock<br />
        Yes, the Gradle, Gradle will rock<br />
        I say, rock code<br />
        Hey, rock code</p>

      <p>Rock code<br />
        (Rock code)<br />
        Rock code<br />
        (Rock code,see every bit compiled)<br />
        Ow!<br />
        Rock code<br />
        (Whoa)<br />
        (It's easy)<br />
        Rock code<br />
        (I say, rock code)<br />
        (Rock code)<br />
        Rock code<br />
        (Code, code)<br />
        Rock code<br />
        (Code, code, code)<br />
