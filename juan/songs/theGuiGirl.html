      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The David Gates "The Goodbye Girl"</p>
      <p>All your sites created<br />
        Your users come to play<br />
        And now that they have found you<br />
        Don't let them slip away<br />
        I know it's hard designin'<br />
        With tags you've learned before<br />
        But darlin' you adjust them just once more<br />
        'cause baby, UI doesn't mean forever<br />
        Let me tell you<br />
        UI doesn't mean<br />
        you'll never have to bother again<br />
        Have your markup &amp; styles all there<br />
        It won't take long today<br />
        'Cause the sites you build my GUI girl<br />
        Will bring us back to you<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We know you've been making<br />
        Sites that work again<br />
        You fight the love you feel for IE<br />
        Instead of leaving it<br />
        But we can't wait forever<br />
        Hoping you can see<br />
        That it's not meant for you and not for me
      </p>
      <p>
        So remember, UI doesn't mean forever<br />
        And HTML 5<br />
        Doesn't mean we'll never see a table again<br />
        Though we may see flash fall apart<br />
        You still will have our hearts<br />
        Validate your tags my GUI Girl<br />
        Cause your pages to load fast<br />
      </p>
