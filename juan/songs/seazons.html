      <h1>"Season with Our Son"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Terry Jacks "Seasons in the Sun" ou Jacques Brel's "Le Moribond"</p>
      <p>
        Goodbye to you our little friend<br />
        We've known each other since you were born back then<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Together we crawled hands and knees<br />
        Learned to love our cheerios<br />
        Warmed our hearts and smiled with ease.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodbye our friend it's hard to die<br />
        and all these words I'm singing as I cry 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the swing has no one there<br />
        Blankets furled up everywhere<br />
        Think of you, wish you were here
      </p>
      <p>
        We had joy we had fun<br />
        Had a season with our son<br />
        But the rooms where he crawled were just seasons<br />
        Out of time...
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodbye, Papa please play for me<br />
        Another stack game with the family<br />
        You could not keep them up for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much time and not for long<br />
        Wonder how come you are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodbye Mama, it's hard to die<br />
        with all the words and soothing you did try
      </p>
      <p>
        Of everything you took good care<br />
        Other children were not here<br />
        When you see them I'll be there.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had joy we had fun<br />
        Had a season with our son<br />
        But the time, not so long like the seasons<br />
        Has all gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodbye Michael from little bro<br />
        You gave me love and helped me from the start<br />
        And even though that I was down<br />
        You would always clown around<br />
        And get my smile back from a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goodbye Nina, it's hard to die<br />
        When your sister is singing lullabies<br />
        How all those things you did show care<br />
        With the laughter and the cheer<br />
        I wish that we could both be there
      </p>
      <p>
        We had joy we had fun<br />
        Had a season with our son<br />
        But the stars out of reach<br />
        Even starfish on the beach
      </p>
      <p>
        All his life, precious one<br />
        had a season with our son<br />
        But the rooms where he crawled were just seasons<br />
        Out of time.
