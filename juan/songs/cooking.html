      <h1>"Cooking"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of J.J. Cale's/Eric Clapton's "Cocaine"</p>
      <p>
        If we're wanting to eat<br />
        Don't have to take her out, cooking<br />
        Use the freshest around<br />
        From in the ground, cooking
      </p>
      <p>
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        Cooking
      </p>
      <p>
        Recipes to use<br />
        You wanna rock them stews, cooking<br />
        When your day is done<br />
        Don't eat on the run, cooking
      </p>
      <p>
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        Cooking<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think it's done<br />
        Then put oven mitts on, cooking<br />
        Don't forget the snacks<br />
        You can't get health back, cooking
      </p>
      <p>
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        Cooking
      </p>
      <p>
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        We can try<br />
        Cooking
      </p>
