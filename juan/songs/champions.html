      <h1>"Champions"</h1>
    <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Queen's "We are the Champions"</p>

      <p>In CPU<br>
      Line after line<br>
      We've built a service<br>
      And committed to Git<br>
      And bitbucket<br>
      We've had reviews<br>
      We've had our share of code in the dev space<br>
      Data comes through<br>
      (And We need to code on and on, and on, and on)</p>

      <p>We are the champions, my friends<br>
      And we'll keep on coding 'til the end<br>
      We are the champions<br>
      We are the champions<br>
      No time for errors<br>
      'Cause we are the champions<br>
      Of the code</p>

      <p>We work in the cloud<br>
      And make service calls<br>
      We make a change refactor too, everything that goes in Git<br>
      We think of all<br>
      Build what our PO proposes<br>
      Jira we use<br>
      Our customers are our focus building trust in the workplace<br>
      And We ain't gonna snooze<br>
      (And We need just code on and on, and on, and on)</p>

      <p>We are the champions, my friends<br>
      And we'll keep on coding 'til the end<br>
      We are the champions<br>
      We are the champions<br>
      No time for errors<br>
      'Cause we are the champions<br>
      Of the code</p>

      <p>We are the champions, my friends<br>
      And we'll keep on coding 'til the end<br>
      Oh, we are the champions<br>
      We are the champions<br>
      No time for errors<br>
      'Cause we are the champions. . .</p>
