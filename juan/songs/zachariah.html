      <h1>"Zachariah"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of John Martyn's "Sapphire"</p>
      <p>
        We watch his days wind down<br />
        Zachariah<br />
        We wish his health turn round<br />
        Our fighter<br />
        We pray he comes around<br />
        Our Father<br />
        We watch his fluids run<br />
        So tired<br />
        Clings to<br />
        To Sue<br />
        Clings to<br />
        To Sue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much more we can do<br />
        No other place to go<br />
        Oh that we may lose our sweet Zachariah<br />
        A precious gift to us<br />
        There's only One we trust<br />
        Oh the days we'll miss our Zachariah.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We watched him run round<br />
        Sweet child.<br />
        We turned to God in prayer<br />
        Sweet prayer<br />
        We did all that we could<br />
        So tired<br />
        We watch him fade away<br />
        watch him respire<br />
        Clings to<br />
        To Sue.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much more we can do<br />
        No other place to go<br />
        Oh the day we lose our Zachariah<br />
        A precious gift to us<br />
        There's only One we trust<br />
        Oh the days we'll miss our Zachariah.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        No other place to go<br />
        Not much more we can do<br />
        Ooh, we dream about Zachariah<br />
        Not much more we can do<br />
        No other place to go<br />
        We need the grace to go without Zachariah<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A precious gift to us<br />
        There's only One we trust<br />
        Oh since we may now lose our sweet Zachariah.<br />
        There's only One we trust<br />
        A precious gift to us<br />
        Oh, we may lose our sweet Zachariah.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Not much more we can do<br />
        No other place to go<br />
        Oh we may lose our sweet Zachariah.<br />
