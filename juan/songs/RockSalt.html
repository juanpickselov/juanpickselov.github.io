      <h1>"Rock Salt"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Police's "Roxanne"</p>
      <p>Rock Salt, you will have to put on the halite<br />
        The Snows not over<br />
        You will have to melt our snow banks overnight<br />
        Rock Salt, you do have to clear that mess alright<br />
        Work the sleet more runny<br />
        I don't care if it's day or if it's night</p>

      <p>Rock Salt, you will have to put on the halite<br />
        Rock Salt, you will have to put on the halite<br />
        Put on the halite, Put on the halite<br />
        Put on the halite, Put on the halite<br />
        Put on the halite, oh</p>

      <p>I loved you since I threw ya<br />
        I wouldn't walk without ya<br />
        I need to tell you that I just fell<br />
        I won't share you with my neighborhood<br />
        I know the snow is piled up<br />
        So go ahead and melt it<br />
        Told you once I will tell you again it's my driveway</p>

      <p>Rock Salt, you will have to put on the halite<br />
        Rock Salt, you will have to put on the halite<br />
        You will have to put on the halite<br />
        Put on the halite, Put on the halite</p>
