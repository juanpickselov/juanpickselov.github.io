      <h1>"Stairway To Maven"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven"</p>
        <p>There's a lady who codes with refactors so bold<br />
          And she's trying the stairway to maven<br />
          When she gits there she knows, if the repos are closed<br />
          With a clone she can git what she came for<br />
          Ooh, ooh, and she's trying the stairway to maven</p>
        <p>There's a card on the wall that she points to be sure<br />
          'Cause you know sometimes cards have new stories<br />
          XML by its looks, there's a pom file to sling<br />
          Sometimes part of our files are mis-versioned<br />
          Ooh, it makes me thunder<br />
          Ooh, it makes me thunder</p>
        <p>There's a failing I get when I first write a test<br />
          And my pairing is coding for passing<br />
          When my tests, they go green, brings refactoring ease<br />
          But the choices of tools to clean install<br />
          Ooh, it makes me thunder<br />
          Ooh, it really makes me thunder</p>
        <p>And configured you'll swoon while it downloads the moon<br />
          Then the plugins will bleed us a season<br />
          And a new day is gone for those who planned long<br />
          And the madness of psycho like laughter</p>
        <p>If there's a bust in your hudson, don't be alarmed now<br />
          It's just maven goals or project clean<br />
          Yes, there are two paths you can go try, but one's a long run<br />
          There's still time to change the code you're on<br />
          And it makes me thunder</p>
        <p>Your headache's bumming and just won't go, in case you don't know<br />
          The builder's calling you to join in<br />
          Dear lady, can you bear the repos and do they grow<br />
          Your stairway thrives on it downloading tons.</p>
        <p>And as we send on down the code<br />
          Our hallowed builder takes its toll<br />
          There codes a lady we all know<br />
          Who learns late nights and wants to grow<br />
          Now refactoring with teams so bold</p>
        <p>And if you listen very hard<br />
          The pom will come to you at last<br />
          When all is done and done is all, yeah<br />
          To be unblocked and let it roll</p>
        <p>And she's trying the stairway to maven</p>
