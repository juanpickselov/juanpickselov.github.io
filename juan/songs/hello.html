      <h1>"Hello (from the Opt Command)"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Adele's "Hello"</p>
      <p>Hello, I.T.<br />
        I was wondering if later all your peers would like to meet<br />
        To go over everything<br />
        We say this time's proposed to hear ya<br />
        But we ain't done much hearing</p>

      <p>Hello, do you hear me<br />
        I'm in command center asking about who we need to reach<br />
        Well we'll wait longer and see<br />
        We've forgotten now if all the tasks you told us are complete</p>

      <p>There's just a conference between us<br />
        And a million files</p>

      <p>Hello from the Opt Command<br />
        We must have asked a thousand times<br />
        To tell us your status if everything tasked is done<br />
        But when we call you never seem to have known</p>

      <p>Hello from the Opt side<br />
        At least we can say that we've tried<br />
        Do tell us your status of tasks you did start<br />
        But it'd be better to clearly appear that you have filled in some more</p>

      <p>Hello, where are you?<br />
        It's so critcial for us to talk about SharePoint I'm sorry<br />
        I hope that you'll tell<br />
        Did you ever mark it up on that form where such things ever happen</p>

      <p>It's no secret that the both of us<br />
        Are running out of time</p>

      <p>So hello from the Opt Command<br />
        We must have asked a thousand times<br />
        To tell us your status if everything tasked is done<br />
        But when we call you never seem to have known<br />
        Hello from the Opt side<br />
        At least we can say that we've tried<br />
        Do tell us your status of tasks you did start<br />
        But it'd be better to clearly appear that you have filled in some more</p>

      <p>Ooooohh, some more<br />
        Ooooohh, some more<br />
        Ooooohh, some more<br />
        Some more</p>

      <p>Hello from the Opt Command<br />
        We must have asked a thousand times<br />
        To tell us your status if everything tasked is done<br />
        But when we call you never seem to have known<br />
        Hello from the Opt side<br />
        At least we can say that we've tried<br />
        Do tell us your status of tasks you did start<br />
        But it'd be better to clearly appear that you have filled in some more</p>
