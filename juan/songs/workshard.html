  <h1>"They Work Hard For the Content"</h1>
  <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Donna Summer's "She Works Hard for the Money"</p>

  <p>They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you're gonna' read it right?<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you're gonna' read it right?</p>

    <p>Creators there with their desks that stand<br>
    Keys thunder where they sit<br>
    And it's strange to them<br>
    Some people cannot read anything<br>
    Nine A.M. on the hour hand<br>
    And they're waiting for a build<br>
    And they're waiting real patient<br>
    Just watching for its publishing</p>

    <p>They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better spell things right<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for your content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better spell things right</p>

    <p>Some Engineers have come and gone<br>
    And they've helped a lot with care<br>
    Of the ones who commit<br>
    Their markdown clearly needs them here<br>
    They are so precise, writing day to day<br>
    From simple markdown, pages display<br>
    But it's worth it all<br>
    To hear them say that they care</p>

    <p>They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better read it, right?</p>

    <p>They already know<br>
    They've seen some bad lines<br>
    They already know<br>
    There'll be some good lines<br>
    They'll never sell out<br>
    They never will<br>
    Not for a dollar, Bill<br>
    They work hard</p>

    <p>They work hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better spell things right<br>
    Hard for the content<br>
    So hard for the content<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better read it, right? (Alright)<br>
    They work hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for the content)<br>
    So hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better spell things right<br>
    They work hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for the content)<br>
    So hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)<br>
    Work so hard for the content<br>
    So you better read it, right? (Alright)<br>
    They work hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for the content)<br>
    So hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)<br>
    They work hard for the content<br>
    So you better spell things right<br>
    They work hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for the content)<br>
    So hard for the content (Hard, hard, hard for it, honey)</p>
