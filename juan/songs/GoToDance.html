    <h1>"Go To Dance"</h1>
    <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Men At Work's "Safety Dance"</p>
    <p>
      F-L-U-F-F-Y<br/>
      Go, dance!
    </p>
    <p>
      We can dance before retro<br/>
      We can see our team online<br/>
      It's your Teams one chance and if they won't dance<br/>
      We'll need to send Rosanne
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we can go where we want to<br/>
      A place with telepresence find<br/>
      And we can act like we code from out of this world<br/>
      leave our zeal not far behind
    </p>
    <p>
      And go to dance
    </p>
    <p>
      We can dance before retro<br/>
      We can see our team online<br/>
      It's your Teams one chance and if they won't dance<br/>
      We'll need to send Rosanne
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we can go where we want to<br/>
      A place with telepresence find<br/>
      And we can act like we code from out of this world<br/>
      leave our zeal not far behind
    </p>
    <p>
      And Go To dance<br/>
      (Dansez!)
    </p>
    <p>
      We can dance how we want to<br/>
      Thought, like Wang Chung? Well so did I<br/>
      And we can dress real neat from our hats to our feet<br/>
      And surprise teams with our Go To style
    </p>
    <p>
      Say, we'll react if we want to<br/>
      If we don't, nobody will<br/>
      And you can act real cool and totally be moved<br/>
      And go to dance like an imbecile
    </p>
    <p>
      And say, go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everything's fusion controlled<br/>
      Go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      We're doing it from point to point<br/>
      Go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everybody look at your cams<br/>
      go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everybody's taking a chance
    </p>
    <p>
      Go To dance<br/>
      Oh well, the go to dance<br/>
      Ah yes, the go to dance
    </p>
    <p>
      F-L-U-F-F-Y<br/>
      Go, dance
    </p>
    <p>
      We can dance if we want to<br/>
      We've got all our teams aligned<br/>
      As long as we amuse it, never gonna lose it<br/>
      Everything'll map out right
    </p>
    <p>
      We can dance before retro<br/>
      We can see our team online<br/>
      It's your Teams one chance and if they won't dance<br/>
      We'll need to send Rosanne
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everything's fusion controlled<br/>
      go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      We're doing it from point to point<br/>
      go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everybody look at your cams<br/>
      go to dance, go to dance<br/>
      Everybody's taking a chance
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh well, the go to dance<br/>
      Ah yes, the go to dance<br/>
      Oh well, the go to dance<br/>
      Oh well, the go to dance<br/>
      Oh yes, the go to dance<br/>
      Oh, the go to dance, yeah<br/>
      Well, it's the go to dance<br/>
      It's the go to dance<br/>
      Well, it's the go to dance<br/>
      Oh, it's the go to dance<br/>
      Oh, it's the go to dance<br/>
      Oh, it's the go to dance
