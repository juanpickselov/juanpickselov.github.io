      <h1>"Coders on the Swarm"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Doors "Riders On the Storm"</p>

      <p>Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm<br />
        From waterfall forlorn<br />
        To agile team we're born<br />
        Take a card but not alone<br />
        And refactor what is shown<br />
        Coders on the Swarm</p>

      <p>There's some really killer code<br />
        Our brains churning out a load<br />
        Tests all along the way<br />
        Our inner children play<br />
        In our plans we all take pride<br />
        Sweet mingle they reside</p> 

      <p>Sure gotta move the cards we can<br />
        Sure gotta move the cards we can<br />
        Tack them up by hand<br />
        Make us understand<br />
        On this work we depend<br />
        Retrospectives at the end<br /> 
        Sure gotta move the cards we can</p>


      <p>Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm<br />
        From waterfall forlorn<br />
        To agile team we're born<br />
        Take a card but not alone<br />
        And refactor what is shown<br />
        Coders on the Swarm</p>

      <p>Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm<br />
        Coders on the Swarm</p>
