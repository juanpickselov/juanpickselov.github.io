      <h1>"Diaper Change"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Wayne Newton's "Danke Schoen"</p>
      <p>(to the tune of Wayne Newton's "Danke Schoen",<br /> for parents everywhere  when solid foods are introduced)
      </p>
      <p>Diaper change, darling diaper change<br />
        Thank you for all the joyful stains<br />
        hold your nose, seconds holding breath
      </p>
      <p>Diaper change, darling diaper change<br />
        oh that smell, it had quite a range<br />
        I recall diapers in a pail<br />
        what a mess, I confess, wiping all
      </p>
      <p>Diaper change, darling diaper change<br />
        Thank you for the poops down the drain<br />
        I can see, stains drawn with some pee<br />
        Solids introduced, for all time<br />
        changed my mind, smells not fine</p>
      <p>Diaper change, darling diaper change<br />
        Thanks for peeing on me again<br />
        Though we throw them all out of the way<br />
        Still the memory stays, for always<br />
        My nose says, diaper change
      </p>
      <p>Diaper change, darling diaper change<br />
        I said, thanks for peeing on me again<br />
        Though we throw them all out of the way<br />
        Still the memory stays, for always<br />
        My nose says, diaper change
      </p>
      <p>Diaper change<br />
        oh how they smell<br />
        Diaper change
      </p>
