      <h1>"My Iteration"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Who's "My Generation"</p>
      <p>People code to reach burn d-down<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        'Cause of lots of c-c-cards around<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        Things we  do are agile r-r-rolled<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        We hope its DRY before it gets old<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)</p>

      <p>This is my iteration<br />
        This is my iteration, baby</p>

      <p>Why don't you all t-test away<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        And try hard to figure what it all s-s-says<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        We're not trying to have big big s-s-sessions<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)<br />
        We're just talkin' 'bout an iteration<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)</p>

      <p>This is my iteration<br />
        This is my iteration, baby</p>

        Yeah, We hope its DRY before it gets old<br />(Talkin' 'bout my iteration)</p>

      <p>This is my iteration<br />
