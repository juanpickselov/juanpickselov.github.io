            <h1>"I Code Alone"</h1>
            <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of George Thorogood's "I Drink Alone"</p>
            <p>I code alone, yeah <br />
                with nobody else<br />
                I code alone, yeah<br />
                with nobody else<br />
                You know when I code alone<br />
                I prefer to be by myself</p>

            <p>Never pairing just to make tests first<br />
                I don't want no ATDD<br />
                Just me and a good compiler<br />
                that's all I ever need<br />
                'Cause I code alone, yeah<br />
                with nobody else<br />
                Yeah, you know when I code alone<br />
                I prefer to be by myself</p>

            <p>The other night I sat typing<br/>
                And I wrote many horrible reams<br />
                So I thought how my pal Mac handles<br />
                all this without pairing teams<br />
                And we code alone, yeah<br/>
                with nobody else<br />
                Yeah, you know when I code alone<br/>
                I prefer to be by myself</p>

            <p>The other day I got invited to a review<br>
                But I stayed home instead<br>
                Busted by my pal Uncle Robert<br />
                and refactor green and red<br />
                And we code alone, yeah<br />
                With nobody else<br />
                Yeah, you know when I code alone<br />
                I prefer to be by myself</p>

            <p>My whole company done give up on me<br />
                And it makes me feel oh so bad<br />
                The only one who will hang out with me<br />
                Is my dear old friend RAD <br />
                And we code alone, yeah<br />
                With nobody else<br />
                Yeah, you know when I code alone<br>
                I prefer to be by myself</p>
