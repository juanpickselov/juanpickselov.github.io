            <h1>"Kung Fu Coding"</h1>
            <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting"</p>

            <p>Oh-ho-ho-ho<br>
                Oh-ho-ho-ho<br>
                Oh-ho-ho-ho<br>
                Oh-ho-ho-ho</p>

            <p>An engineer is kung fu coding<br>
                That Chris is fast as lightning<br>
                In fact, more than a little enlightening<br>
                Making apps and expert designing</p>

            <p>And there's helpful documents for other engineers<br>
                There's Tech primers and labs, that are built in markdown<br>
                Building teamwork at the start, and everybody has a part<br>
                From Moneta and a shell, and some kickstarts for the hip</p>

            <p>An engineer is kung fu coding, huh<br>
                That Chris is fast as lightning<br>
                In fact, more than a little enlightening, hey, yeah<br>
                Making apps and expert designing</p>

            <p>Got that funky smiling grin and so inspiring<br>
                He says, "Keep it positive, don't feed the trolls"<br>
                He helps all those to understand, who start working with the man<br>
                And with his solid craftsmanship, working with him is worth the trip</p>

            <p>An engineer is kung fu coding (Huh!)<br>
                That Chris is fast as lightning (Ha!)<br>
                In fact, more than a little enlightening (Huh!)<br>
                Making apps and expert designing (Ha!)</p>

            <p>Oh yeah<br>

                (Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)<br>
                (Oh-ho-ho-ho, ha)<br>
                Code on, code on, code on, code on<br>
                Sure enough</p>

            <p>An engineer is kung fu coding (Huh!)<br>
                That Chris is fast as lightning (Ha!)<br>
                In fact, more than a little enlightening (Huh!)<br>
                Making apps and expert designing (Ha!)</p>

            <p>(Oh-ho-ho-ho) Kung fu coding<br>
