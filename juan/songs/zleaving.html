      <h1>"Zachariah Leaving"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Mamas and the Papas' "California Dreaming"</p>

      <p>
        All the leaves are brown<br/>
        All the leaves are brown<br />
        And the sky is grey<br />
        And the sky is grey<br />
        He's been through a lot<br />
        He's been through a lot<br />
        In his Autumn stay<br />
        In his Autumn stay<br />
        He'll be safe and warm<br />
        He'll be safe and warm<br />
        Now that he's home today<br />
        Now that he's home today<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        On such an autumn day
      </p>
      <p>
        Stopped in was a nurse<br />
        who helped us all the way<br />
        Well, I got down all the steps<br />
        Got down all the steps<br />
        And I began to pray<br />
        I began to pray<br />
        Do like the doctor as I'm told<br />
        Doctor as I'm told<br />
        He needs his meds today<br />
        He needs his meds today<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        On such an autumn day
      </p>
      <p>
        All the leaves are brown<br />
        All the leaves are brown<br />
        And the sky is grey<br />
        And the sky is grey<br />
        He's been through a lot<br />
        He's been through a lot<br />
        In his Autumn stay<br />
        In his Autumn stay<br />
        I need to really thank her<br />
        I need to really thank her<br />
        He would be ok<br />
        He would be ok<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        On such an autumn day<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        On such an autumn day<br />
        Zachariah's Leaving<br />
        On such an autumn day
