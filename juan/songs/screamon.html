            <h1>"Scream On"</h1>
            <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Aerosmith's "Dream On"</p>
            <p>Every time that I sit in the office<br>
            All those teams in my space getting louder<br>
            The quiet's gone<br>
            Like a cry, goes on and on<br>
            Happens every day<br>
            Everybody's got some news to loudly say</p>

            <p>Oh, no nobody knows<br>
            here it comes and there it goes<br>
            We know when everybody's in<br>
            You got to block it out now to win</p>

            <p>Tried giving them looks, wasted ages<br>
            Have to learn from decibel gauges<br>
            You know it's true, oh<br>
            All the sounds come back to you</p>

            <p>Scream with me, scream to your peers<br>
            Scream above chatter, scream to those near<br>
            Scream with me, it's not hushed for today<br>
            Maybe tomorrow, the sound will get carried away</p>

            <p>Yeah, scream with me, scream to your peers<br>
            Scream above chatter, scream to those near<br>
            Scream with me, it's not hushed for today<br>
            Maybe tomorrow, the sound will get carried away</p>

            <p>Scream on, scream on, scream on<br>
            Scream until your teams hear you</p>

            <p>Scream on, scream on, scream on<br>
            Scream until your screams come through</p>

            <p>Scream on, scream on, scream on<br>
            Scream on, scream on, scream on<br>
            Scream on, ah!</p>

            <p>Scream with me, scream to your peers<br>
            Scream above chatter, scream to those near<br>
            Scream with me, it's not hushed for today<br>
            Maybe tomorrow, the sound will get carried away<br>
            Scream with me, scream to your peers<br>
            Scream above chatter, scream to those near<br>
            Scream with me, it's not hushed for today<br>
            Maybe tomorrow, the sound will get carried away</p>
