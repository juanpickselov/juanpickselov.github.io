      <h1>"Coding Go"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Disney's "Let It Go"</p>

      <p>The screen glows bright on the laptop tonight<br>
        Lots of edits and caffeine<br> 
        with testing and concentration<br>
        And it builds fast nice and clean</p>

        <p>Tests are running and churning on the command line<br>
        Commits all checked in, CI shows compiled<br>
        Expressiveness, concurrency<br>
        Add the Go plugin in your I D E<br>
        Camel case things, just name them so<br>
        We'll now use Go</p>

        <p>Coding Go, coding go<br>
        Consoles are back for more<br>
        Coding Go, coding go<br>
        Building apps is not a chore<br>
        Command line args they're still here today<br>
        Terminal stays on<br>
        Consoles never bothered me anyway</p>

        <p>It's funny how some typing forces one's skin to crawl<br>
        And shortcuts that once controlled them can't be let go at all<br>
        It's time to see what it can do<br>
        To mess with keyboards which work too<br>
        No right, no wrong, let icons be<br>
        We're free</p>

        <p>Coding Go, coding go<br>
        I am one with the command line<br>
        Coding Go, coding go<br>
        We're building C L I<br>
        Subcommands and flags today<br>
        Terminal stays on</p>

        <p>Go powered modules through the open source around<br>
        With consoles firing brazen command line apps abound<br>
        And some thought typing in commands would never last<br>
        I'm never going back, to icons in the past</p>

        <p>Coding Go, coding go<br>
        Which we will write share and build upon<br>
        Coding Go, coding go<br>
        That picture world is gone<br>
        Where commands see the light of day<br>
        Terminal stays on<br>
        Consoles never bothered me anyway</p>
