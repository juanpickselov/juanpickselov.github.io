The screen glows bright on the laptop tonight
Lots of edits and caffeine 
with testing and concentration
And it builds fast nice and clean

Tests are running and churning on the command line
Commits all checked in, CI shows compiled
Expressiveness, concurrency
Add the Go plugin in your I D E
Camel case things, just name them so
We'll now use Go

Coding Go, coding go
Consoles are back for more
Coding Go, coding go
Building apps is not a chore
Command line args they're still here today
Terminal stays on
Consoles never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some typing forces one's skin to crawl
And shortcuts that once controlled them can't be let go at all
It's time to see what it can do
To mess with keyboards which work too
No right, no wrong, let icons be
We're free

Coding Go, coding go
I am one with the command line
Coding Go, coding go
We're building C L I
Subcommands and flags today
Terminal stays on

Go powered modules through the open source around
With consoles firing brazen command line apps abound
And some thought typing in commands would never last
I'm never going back, to icons in the past

Coding Go, coding go
Which we will write share and build upon
Coding Go, coding go
That picture world is gone
Where commands see the light of day
Terminal stays on
Consoles never bothered me anyway
