            <h1>"Build the Page"</h1>
            <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Bob Seger's "Turn the Page"</p>
            <p>
                On a strong and local server<br />
                and an IDE<br />
                You can render with an engine<br />
                markup written out by hand<br />
                You can link content together<br />
                in the site you viewed the mockups for<br />
                and your tags will soon be rendering<br />
                looking like phase 2<br />
                When you're codin' sixteen hours<br />
                and there's testin' more to do<br />
                And you don't feel the points flying,<br />
                you just wish the card was through
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I am<br />
                In the code again<br />
                There I am<br />
                Up on the wall<br />
                Here I go<br />
                Playin' cards again<br />
                There I go<br />
                Build the page
            </p>
            <p>
                When you walk into a deployment,<br />
                built out from the code<br />
                And you've passed the ITSM<br />
                as your server's taken hold<br />
                Dependencies don't bother you<br />
                working nicely with your code
            </p>
            <p>
                Most times you don't have to stop,<br />
                other times you do<br />
                Clear out those old caches,<br />
                was that in our release plan?<br />
                And you always have steps numbered,<br />
                you put them on the LAN
            </p>
            <p>Here I am<br />
                In the code again<br />
                There I am<br />
                Up on the wall<br />
                Here I go<br />
                Playin' cards again<br />
                There I go<br />
                Build the page
            </p>
            <p>
                Out there in the spotlight<br />
                all your metrics filed away<br />
                Every bit of coverage<br />
                big charts out on display<br />
                As the scripts pull out of Maven<br />
                getting downloads for the day
            </p>
            <p>
                Later in an email<br />
                as your sign off has been read<br />
                Wait for kudos from all the managers<br />
                ringin' in your head<br />
                You smoke test one last story card<br />
                rememberin' what it said
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I am<br />
                In the code again<br />
                There I am<br />
                Up on the wall<br />
                Here I go<br />
                Playin' cards again<br />
                There I go<br />
                Build the page<br />
                Here I am<br />
                In the code again<br />
                There I am<br />
                Up on the wall<br />
                Here I go<br />
                Playin' cards again<br />
                There I go<br />
                Build the page<br />
                There I go<br />
                There I go
            </p>
