      <h1>"Oh SharePoint"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Journey's "Oh Sherry"</p>
      <p>So soon I'll be gone<br />
        knowing how you make me reel<br />
        And you shouldn't go on<br />
        after all your tags ordeal<br />
        Oh there must've been a reason<br />
        now there just must be something else<br />
        And we shall sure be over</p>

      <p>Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long<br />
        Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long</p>

      <p>But it won't continue<br />
        You'll no longer hurt me<br />
        You'd be better off all gone<br />
        It's just nuts who you think you'd be</p>

      <p>But you know that there's a fever<br />
        One that Walken will find nowhere else<br />
        Can't you feel it burnin' on and on</p>

      <p>Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long<br />
        Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long</p>

      <p>But you should just be gone<br />
        Gone you know, far away<br />
        And you shouldn't take long<br />
        Now just go why must you stay</p>

      <p>Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long<br />
        Oh SharePoint, your code<br />
        So long, so long</p>
