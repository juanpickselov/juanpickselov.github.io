      <h1>"Every Breath"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics reworked by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of The Police's "Every Breath You Take"</p>
      <p>Every breath you take<br />
        Every move you make<br />
        Every fond embrace<br />
        Every test you take</p>

      <p>I'll be watching you</p>

      <p>Every single day<br />
        Every ward you stay<br />
        Every pain displayed<br />
        Every night I pray</p>

      <p>I'll be watching you</p>

      <p>Oh can't you see<br />
        Use your lungs to breathe<br />
        How my poor heart aches with every breath you take</p>

      <p>Every med you take<br />
        Every scowl or shake<br />
        Every smile awake<br />
        Every gain you make</p>

      <p>I'll be watching you</p>

      <p>Since you've gone I've shed tears around this place<br />
        I dream at night I can't even see your face<br />
        I look around and it's you I can't replace<br />
        I keep crying baby breathe</p>

      <p>Every med you take<br />
        Every scowl or shake<br />
        Every smile awake<br />
        Every gain you make</p>

      <p>I'll be watching you</p>
