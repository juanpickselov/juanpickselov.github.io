    <h1>"Song For Sue"</h1>
    <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Lenon Russell's "A Song For You"</p>

    <p>I lived in different places in a younger time<br />
    Then Susie came along<br />
    I made some new plans<br />
    I asked her into my life's stages<br />
    With a hundred people watching</p>

    <p>And we're a home now<br />
    And I'm singing this song for Sue</p>

    <p>I knew that she was for me<br />
    It's what I hoped would be<br />
    I proposed somewhat oddly<br />
    Sue darling, can't you see?<br />
    You're so important to me<br />
    Susie, I love you truly!</p>

    <p>'Cause we're a home now<br />
    And I'm singing this song for Sue</p>

    <p>You brought us precious children<br />
    with a true love withholding nothing<br />
    We made it through some griveous sad tidings<br />
    And we've seen some much better<br />
    And in his word we live together<br />
    Listen to the commandments<br />
    'Cause our love is there abiding</p>

    <p>I love you in a place<br />
    Where there's no space or time<br />
    I love you for my wife<br />
    You're a friend of mine<br />
    And when my life is over<br />
    Remember when we were together</p>

    <p>We were a home<br />
    And I was singing this song for Sue</p>

    <p>I love you in a place<br />
    Where there's no space or time<br />
    I love you for my wife<br />
    You're a friend of mine<br />
    And when my life is over<br />
    Remember when we were together</p>

    <p>We were a home<br />
    And I was singing this song for Sue<br />
    We were a home<br />
    And I was singing this song for Sue<br />
    We were a home<br />
    And I was singing this song, mm<br />
    Singing this song for Sue</p>
