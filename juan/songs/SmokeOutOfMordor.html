      <h1>"Smoke Out of Mordor"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Deep Purple's "Smoke On the Water"</p>
      <p>
        We all came out to Mordor<br/>
        On the dark Black Gate border line<br/>
        To have some words with a monster<br/>
        We didn't have much time
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Frodo and another<br/>
        Were in the worst place around<br/>
        Brought some creature and a gold ring<br/>
        Burned the place to the ground
      </p>
      <p>
        Smoke out of Mordor<br/>
        A fire in The Eye<br/>
        Smoke out of Mordor
      </p>
      <p>
        They burned down the one ring's house<br/>
        It died with an awful sound<br/>
        A-Funky Gollum running all about<br/>
        Pulled finger off a hand
      </p>
      <p>
        When it all was over<br/>
        We headed back to the Shire<br/>
        But Some's time was running out<br/>
        It seemed that they would leave the place
      </p>
      <p>
        Smoke out of Mordor<br/>
        A fire in The Eye<br/>
        Smoke out of Mordor
      </p>
      <p>
        We ended up at Galadriel's<br/>
        She was happy, golden haired<br/>
        But with Grey Havens ships being just outside, heh<br/>
        Taking her outa there
      </p>
      <p>
        With a few goodbyes, heh, a few old friends, heh<br/>
        We bade the place farewell<br/>
        No gladder could we get out of this, heh<br/>
        I know, I know we'll never regret
      </p>
      <p>
        Smoke out of Mordor<br/>
        A fire in The Eye<br/>
        Smoke out of Mordor
      </p>
