      <h1>"Secure The Mall"</h1>
      <p>Lyrics by Juan Pickselov, to the tune of Milye Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball"</p>
      <p>We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain<br />
        We jumped never asking why<br />
        We kissed, I fell under your spell.<br />
        A love no one could deny</p>
      <p>Don't you ever say I just walked away<br />
        I will always want you<br />
        I can't live a lie, running for my life<br />
        I will always want you</p>
      <p>I came in like a wrecking ball<br />
        I never hit so hard in love<br />
        All I wanted was to break your walls<br />
        All you ever did was wreck me<br />
        Yeah, you, you wreck me</p>
      <p>I put you high up in the sky<br />
        And now, you're not coming down<br />
        It slowly turned, you let me burn<br />
        And now, we're ashes on the ground</p>
      <p>Don't you ever say I just walked away<br />
        I will always want you<br />
        I can't live a lie, running for my life<br />
        I will always want you</p>
      <p>I came in like a wrecking ball<br />
        I never hit so hard in love<br />
        All I wanted was to break your walls<br />
        All you ever did was wreck me</p>
      <p>I came in like a wrecking ball<br />
        Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung<br />
        Left me crouching in a blaze and fall<br />
        All you ever did was wreck me<br />
        Yeah, you, you wreck me</p>
      <p>I never meant to start a war<br />
        I just wanted you to let me in<br />
        And instead of using force<br />
        I guess I should've let you win<br />
        I never meant to start a war<br />
        I just wanted you to let me in<br />
        I guess I should've let you win</p>
      <p>Don't you ever say I just walked away
        I will always want you</p>
      <p>I came in like a wrecking ball<br />
        I never hit so hard in love<br />
        All I wanted was to break your walls<br />
        All you ever did was wreck me</p>
      <p>I came in like a wrecking ball<br />
        Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung<br />
        Left me crashing in a blazing fall<br />
        All you ever did was wreck me<br />
        Yeah, you, you wreck me<br />
        Yeah, you, you wreck me</p>
