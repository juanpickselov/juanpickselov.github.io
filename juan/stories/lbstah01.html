    <h2>"What Scup for Lunch"</h2>
    <p>Story by Juan Pickselov</p>
    <p>I woke up one lazy summer morning, in our nice neck of the Cape. I had my mind set on going fishing that day.
        There were some clouds in the sky, but didn't look like it would rain. I went down to the basement to pick out a
        fishing pole and got my tackle box. I didn't pack a lunch, since I wasn't planning to fish all day. Then I walked down to the
        dock.</p>

    <p>I remember thinking I didn't have any sea worms. The bait shop where I used to get them was a far distance away,
        and I was young without sufficient funds. Then I recalled what a new friend I met at the beach said, if you want
        to go fishing, aside from a pole, you have all you need around you on the beach. Periwinkles! Yes periwinkles make
        good bait for catching  fish. I forget his name all these years later, but he was right. You can find periwinkles
        on the rocks in the water, on the pilings of a dock, and on the rocks of a jetty.</p>

    <p>Using another tool found on a beach, a rock, I cracked open a periwinkle and put it on the hook. I was hoping to
        catch some some scup that day. I wondered if any fish would like a periwinkle, and remembered they stay fairly
        well on a hook compared to sea worms. I dropped the hook into the water with a small one or two ounces weight attached,
        and sat patiently on the dock. My patience paid off as I felt nibbles on the line. When I reeled in the fishing line,
        the hook was empty. Success, the fish liked periwinkles!</p>

    <p>Now that I knew fish like periwinkles, I decided to find a bigger one, saw a good sized periwinkle, put it on the hook,
        and tried again. This time I paid closer attention to the fishing pole. When I felt a strong nibble I tugged the line
        and caught a fish. While I was happy I caught a fish, I had to throw the fish back into the ocean, it was so tiny.
        I found another periwinkle, another good size one. I put it on the hook and tried once again.</p>

    <p>I caught another fish but this time, still a small scup, but big enough to keep. I could have lunch from
        it, so I put it in the bucket I had brought with me. I decided to fish a little more. I cracked open another
        periwinkle shell, pulled the snail out, put it on the hook and patiently waited again. Once again I caught one!</p>

    <p>The third fish I caught was even bigger than the second, and while still relatively small together, they'd make a
        nice lunch for one or two people (or maybe more of an appetizer). Knowing that periwinkles would be in good supply at
        the beach for another fishing expedition, I decided to go home for the day and come back to fish another time.</p>

    <p>When I got home I immediately cleaned and filleted the fish, got a pan out to cook them for lunch. I put the fish on a
        plate and brought them in the house so I could cook them. I got out mom 's shiny aluminum fry pan. It looked
        like a hammered aluminum metalwork on the outside with a black paint finish, and a shiny silver smooth surface on the inside.</p>

    <p>I thought I should get something to go with the fish before I started cooking. I planned to make lunch for mom and myself
        since she and I were the only ones home. I went out into the garden and picked out some fresh cucumbers
        and some tomatoes, fresh red ripe tomatoes. I split the cucumbers in four lengthwise and quartered the tomatoes,
        salted them, and put them on two plates.</p>

    <p>I gently sauteed the scup in butter because they were small. They would cook nicely in it without the butter
        getting too hot and burning. They did not take long to cook. I put them on the plates, told my
        mom I made lunch for us, and put it on the table. Mom and I enjoyed the fruits of one of my fishing adventures.</p>
