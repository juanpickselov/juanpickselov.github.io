I woke up in our nice neck of the Cape. It was a lazy summer morning, I had my mind set on going fishing. There were some clouds in the sky but it didn't look like rain. I went down to the basement to pick out a fishing line and got my tackle box. I didn't pack a lunch. I wasn't going to fish all day.

I remember thinking I didn't have any sea worms. the bait shop where I used to get them was a far distance away, I was young and didn't have any money. then I recall what a new friend I met at the beach said, if you want to go fishing, you have all you need around you on the beach. Periwinkles! periwinkles make good bait for catching fish. I forget his name all these years later, but he was right. You can find periwinkles on the rocks in the water. you can find periwinkles on the pilings of the dock and you can find pilings on the rocks of a jetty.

using another tool handy on the beach, a rock, I cracked open a periwinkle and put it on the hook and decided to go fishing for scup. I wondered if the fish would like the periwinkle and I remember they stay fairly well on a hook compared to a sea worm. I dropped the hook into the water with a small one or two ounces weight, and sat patiently on the dock. My patients paid off and I felt nibbles on the line. when I reeled in the fishing line, the hook was empty.

now that I knew the fish like the periwinkles I decided to find a bigger one, put it on the hook, and try again. this time I paid closer attention to the fishing line and when I felt a strong nibble I tugged and I caught a fish. while I was happy I caught a fish , I had to throw the fish back into the ocean. it was so tiny. I found another periwinkle, a good size one this time. put it on the hook and tried once again.

I caught another fish but this time, it was still a small scup but big enough to keep. I could have lunch from it, so I put it in the bucket I had brought with me. I decided to fish a little more. I cracked open another periwinkle shell, pulled the snail out, put it on the hookand patiently waited again.

The third fish I caught was even bigger than the second and while still relatively small together, they'd make a nice lunch for one or two people. Knowing the periwinkles were in good supply at the beach, I decided to go home for the day and come back and fish another time .

when I got home I immediately cleaned the fish and got a pan out to cook them for lunch. I put the fish on a plate and brought them in the house so I could cook them. I got out mom 's. shiny aluminum fry pan. it looked like hammered aluminum on the outside with a black paint finish and a shiny silver color on the inside.

before I started cooking the fish I thought I should get something to go with it to make lunch for myself and my mom since she and I were the only ones home. so I went out into the garden and picked out some fresh cucumbers and some fresh tomatoes, fresh ripe tomatoes. I split the cucumbers in four lengthwise and cut up the tomatoes in quarters, salted them and put them on two plates.

I gently sauteed the scup in butter cuz they were so small. they would cook nicely in it without the butter getting too hot and burning. they did not take long to cook and once done I put them on the plates and told my mom I made lunch for us and put it on the table.
