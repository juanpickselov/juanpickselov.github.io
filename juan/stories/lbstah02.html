    <h2>"The Avenue of Ocean Views"</h2>
    <p>Story by Juan Pickselov</p>
    <p>There were many rooms in the house in our neck of the Cape, but the best room of all wasn't inside it. It had a
        very official title "The Tea Room", and this room had more treasure for a kid than Jim Hawkins could find on
        Treasure Island. There were toy sharks, dolphins, other sea creatures, souvenirs, candy, and of course salt
        water taffy, lots of it. They had other toys too, like the classic yellow Wiffle bat and ball. But the most
        prized treasure of all was made of balsa wood. Balsa wood airplane gliders and the ever fun rubber band powered
        wind up propeller plane.

        Summer days were fun, but one summer day was especially fun, uncle Ed, cousin Ed and I headed to our favorite
        tea room. It was a short walk from the end of the main entry road a brief left turn, then a right down the
        avenue that lead to a view of the ocean. When we walked in we could see the stacks of balsa wood treasure in its
        yellow and red packaging. We both picked one out, and made the short journey back to begin our high flying
        adventure on the Cape.

        The trick to getting the balsa wood planes built was to carefully separate the parts of the plane, have
        patience, and sometimes get help from an X-Acto knife. Depending on the brand or model of the plane, you could
        adjust the position of the wings and slide the pilot into his slot near the front of the plane. Once the planes
        were put together, Ed and I would see how well they would fly. And once we had built one plane, we didn't need
        to read the instructions anymore.

        There was more room to fly the planes in the back yard than the front and its many trees. Sometimes we'd see how
        the planes would do if we tossed them in the air off the deck. They generally flew rather well, and we usually
        stayed at the house with them, thinking if we went to the beach they could fly far enough away into the water to
        be lost at sea. We'd see how far they could glide, or if we could get them to make a couple loops in the air. I
        remember once or twice thinking if I really threw it hard it would really fly a long time. But doing so
        generally got the curved piece of balsa with the pilot on it to fall out, lose part of the tail, or worse, break
        a wing.

        Until I was older I didn't appreciate the views at the end of that road. I focused mainly on the trove of
        treasure and summer fun that awaited at the "Tea Room" just shy of the avenue of ocean views.
